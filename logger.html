    I live in an attic where the termic insulation is not that great. In order to keep track of the gradual
    improvements I perform on the house, I've installed in every room a WiFi node that allows to log temperature and humidity.
    As for now, the system is still purely a prototype with no particular plans for the future.
</p>
<p>
    Each node consist of an ESP8266 with an DHT11 temperature and humidity digitaly sensor. 
    The <a href="vabbuo.it">vabbuo</a> server is programmed to receive data from these nodes and logs everything into a MySQL database.
    A page <a href="/tracker/tracker.html">on this very site</a> allows to display graphs of the logged data.

    There are several problems with the system, the first being the choice of the DHT11 sensor. Precision of the 
    measurament of the temperature is only of one full degree and I have serious doubt of the accuracy and calibration across
    different sensors. On top of that, they seems to fail pretty often.

    The second problem is the fact that the nodes are currently running of old Nokia phone charges. The total energy consuption
    for 7 sensors is about 1W. This is not bad but not grat either. The wire and the charger arre quite ugly to look at.
