<p>Everybody has lying around one of those bulky compact digital cameras. My idea here was to have a pretti uniform solution
	that let's you convert on of those into a timelapse machine. To make a Full HD video are sufficient photos of resolution
	1920x1080 that are equivalent to about 2 megapixels which usually also these older cameras are capable of. The video
	above was taken with a Premier(?) 5Mpx camera of 2005, I'm satisfied with the result, clearly not professional but still
	sufficient to grab those likes on Instagram.
</p>
<p>Sure, the image quality is not defined only by the number of pixels, but using a 5 megapixel camera not at its maximum
	resolution but with its best image quality led to quite good results. Obviously some noise is there especially when
	the light is scarce. Another problem is the limited possibility of tweaking the camera settings, for example in the
	video above there is a precise moment when the white balance shifts drammatically. This is simply because I had to leave
	it in auto.
</p>
<p>The first thing I learned about timelapses is the foundamental importance of having a good tripod. I have very nice timelapses
	made with this is setup that sadly are not worth publishing because too shaky because of the wind. Battery power is
	also quite important, as you can imagine. The system, comprehending the camera, is powered by a 12V battery.
</p>
<p>The idea is actually very simple: a jig for the compact camera that periodicaly presses the shutter button. The motion
	is achieved through a solenoid controlled by an embedded system. The control board has a screen which displays the interval
	and the battery level, and it's also used for setting up the timing. The inputs are an ON/OFF switch and two potentiometers
	one used to control the delay between photos, the other to calibrate the interaction with the two stage shutter button.
</p>
<p>The latter was quite a complex part to deal with since the button was not intended to be used this way for sure. The
	intended use-case scenario involves a human feeling with his touch the first pressing and wait until the camera has
	focus then, after that, use more force to trigger the second level of pressing and snap that photo. The difference in
	force is quite subtle, moreover the focus time is not constant but usually is the same into the same timelapse since
	the conditions don't vary lot. Both of this quantities can be fine tuned using the the second potentiometer.
