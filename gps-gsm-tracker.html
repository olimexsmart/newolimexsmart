<h1>GPS boat tracker</h1>
<p>
	My father loves to sail on our old but reliable sailboat. But since our father turned 60 me 
	and my mother have been concerned with his safety in these periods of his that can last several
	weeks. 
</p> 
<p>
	The project consist in an Arduino system installed on the boat, powered directly from the boat's batteries.
	The box consist in a Mega2560 MCU in a breakout configuration intead of the standard Arduino footprint, 
	to save some space.
	Connected to MCU there is a UBlox GPS module, a Quelctek M10 GSM module and a SD card reader. A couple of LEDs and
	a homebrew watchdog complete the system. Why a watchdog? Well the GSM module, which BTW is a genuine Arduino shield,
	comes with an official library that occasionaly hangs. And by hangs I mean that it deadlocks the system
	into functions where are present while loops which conditions gets never satisfied. The library generates quite a 
	considerable amount of compilation warnings too, which is a clue that is no longer mantained. It makes sense since
	GSM shield are retired products by now. I have modified some of the loops integrating an additional check for
	a maximum number of loops, but still a watchdog never hurts.
</p>
<p>
	The watchdog is nothing more than an ATTiny85 programmed to have an interrupt on a pin which overwrites an internal 
	variable to the current number of milliseconds elapsed since power up.
	The main loop simply checks that the time since the last interrupt is under a certain threshold, in this particular case
	3 minutes. The Mega MCU at every main loop cycle triggers the watchdog interrupt. If the Mega deadlocks, the timer system
	on the ATTiny exipers and both the Mega and the GPS module get a reset impulse.

<p>
	The data collected from the GPS is then sent to the <a href="vabbuo.it">vabbuo</a> server through a GET request and
	there a PHP script stores the data on the MySQL database. Pretty basic part here. A web page is served 
	<a href="">on this very site</a> using Google Maps APIs to display the routes sailed by 
	my father in real time.
</p>
<p>	
	Then what is the SD card reader for?
	Well the problem that in the open sea cellular signal might not be present all the time. My father generally avoids 
	sailing too far from the coast, but still there might be some blindspots. The SD card serves as a high-volume, 
	non-volatile memory. In RAM there would be not enough space since the entries are saved as an URL encoded string of 
	key-values pairs. Maybe a not the most elegant solution, but having a couple of GB on board saved me in terms of 
	debugging because it allows me to store all the debug prints on it like some sort of device logger.
