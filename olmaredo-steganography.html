	Steganography is a technique that consists in hiding a message into another information media.
	The main application is to convey information secretly using an open channel. 
	Other uses could exploit steganography to add metadata about the carrying stream.
	This Android app was developed implementing a spread-spectrum techique with images as carrying media.
	Spread-spectrum means to spread the message across the spectrum of the carrier. 
	In other words, instead of alterating directly the carrier in the time (or space in case of images) domain,
	the carrier is first transformed into the frequency domain, then the message is added. At last everything
	is trasmormed back in the original domain.
</p>

<p>
	The added complexity of this technique is compesated by the message being more unnoticable. 
	Alterating the carrier directly into the original domain results in more noticeable changes into the frequency domain.
	That said, with spread-spectrum the retreival of the message is not anymore a deterministic process. 
	During the embedding process is necessary to specify an embedding power, the higher the power, 
	the lower the error probability. At the same time, with higher power distorting patterns in the carrier 
	become more evident.
</p>

<p>
	The foundamental part that links the message and the carrier, allowing thus to separate them, is the key. 
	The key is generated optimally starting from the carrier. This means that same images have same keys. 
	The app stringyfies the key allowing to be sent in text message form.
