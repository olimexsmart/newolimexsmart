<h1>Beating IoT Sign</h1>

	I love flea markets and my city happens to host one regularly every month.
	Some stands are there since forever, but sometimes something new pops up.
	This time the new guy in town was an old man just selling letters from neon sign.
	I saw a big blue 'O', I had no idea what to do with it, but I bought it anyway.
	At that point I needed an idea that took almost two full months to come up.
	It obviously needed some RGB lighting but it would be cool that instead of random it could display some sort of information.
	Why not to display my heartbeats? I have been wearing a FitBit smartwatch since 2015, the information is there, it just a matter of retreiving it.
</p>
<p>
	I started studying OAuth2 API, the one used by FitBit servers.
	For personal use the data can be retreived without particular agreements, just create an account in their developer section.
	Things are different for large data requests and commercial uses.
	There are different OAuth2 libraries for PHP and initially I wanted to use one of them blindly, but when studying the protocol I
	realized that in reality all the problem reduced to a handful of GET and POST requests.
	Not without initial struggle, I managed to tailor the requests in order to obtain stable queries.
	The protocol requires obtaining an access token and refreshing it periodically.
	The access token is then used to make data requests to the server.
</p>
<p>
	The <a href="vabbuo.it">vabbuo</a> server manages the OAuth2 protocol, keeping the access token refreshed.
	The data is periodically loaded into a MySQL database.
	The O sign is fitted with an ESP8266 connected to the same LAN of the server. Every minute polls the server for new data.
	On the server a PHP script retrives data from the database and sends a simple response containg just the heartbeat rate.
	In order to save energy, the FitBit smartwatch sends data to the smarthphone sporadically or when asked to. This does not allow the server
	to have fresh data in real-time, not that it would be useful in normal circumstances.
	For this reason, the sign displays the heart rate of the day before, same time of the day.
	A simple lighting effect emulates an heart beating.
