<h1>Beating IoT Sign</h1>
<p>
	I love flea markets and my city happens to host one regularly every month. 
	Some stands are there since forever, but sometimes something new pops up. 
	This time the new guy in town was an old man just selling letters from neon sign. 
	No idea on how he got those, I hope were not stolen.
	I saw a big blue 'O', I had no idea what to do with it, but I bought it anyway. 
	At that point I needed an idea that took almost two full months to come up. 
	It obviously needed some RGB lighting and it would be cool that instead of random it could display some information with those colors.
	Why not to display my heartbeats? I have been wearing a FitBit Charge HR for two years at least, the information is there, the point is to retreive it. 
	I started studying OAuth2 API, the one used by FitBit servers. 
	For personal use the data can be retreived without particular agreements, just create an account in their developer section.
	Things are different for large data requests and commercial uses.
	There are different OAuth2 libraries for PHP and initially I wanted to use one of them blindly.
	But when studying the protocol I realized that in reality all the problem reduced to a handful of GET and POST requests.
	Not without initial struggle, I managed to tailor the requests in order to obtain stable queries.
	The protocol has two separate phases
