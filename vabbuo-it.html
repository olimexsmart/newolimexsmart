								One day quite some time ago I got a flat Internet connection at home. It was very exciting and all, but after spending
								some time on videos of people getting hurt I was quickly bored. I had the hole world at the reach of that white bar
								that the blinking cursors seemed like a timer counting how much time I didn't spend searching for stuff. So I searched
								for something random. Com'on I already searched my name, so what? In italian "boh" is something like "No Idea"
								or "I don't know", a sort of "Meh...". So I searched for "boh" on the italian Google and the first result
								was for a site - <a href="www.boh.it">boh.it</a> - which claimed to be the first "site" where there is nothing. For
								some reason I fell in love with it, the first thing welcoming you was a light blue page with a big dark blu round button
								in the middle of it. I mean imagining to enter it the first time the experience is quite confusing. What is this thing?
								Because you where actually expeting something from a site named "boh"? It was simply a discovery. Satisfying the curiosity
								of clicking on the button you where redirected to a page explaining the phylosophy of the thing, along a with a simple
								form that asked for an email and a message. Sometimes I filled it up and submit it but never got a response, maybe I
								got some more spam instead. Sadly from the beginning of summer <a href="www.boh.it">boh.it</a> is down, probably because the
								owner got tired of paying for the hosting.
							</p>
							<p> <span class="image right"><img src="images/vabbuo1.png" alt="" /></span>
								Anyway in the years I used <a href="www.boh.it">boh.it</a> for testing Internet connection and I really felt like missing
								a tool when became unreachable. In the same period I was starting an internship in a web development company so I got
								an idea about filling that unbearable hole in the World Wide Web. By the why through WHOISing the URL I tryed to contract
								the domain owner by I got no response and the domain expires in 2018 so, you know, things might be happen. I bought
								the <a href="vabbuo.it">vabbuo</a> domain and dove into this new world, since I actually never got a formal education
								in web development. The underlining idea was still the same: something completely useless but with a pretentious meaning.
								The button is still there, but green instead. Unexpectedly senteces snow from the top to make your life much better
								and the background changes color smoothly you know man, great stuff. Accordingly the form know lets you submit new senteces
								along with some other information.
							</p>
							<p> <span class="image left"><img src="images/vabbuo4.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								Touching instead some technicalities, the welcome page is essentially made from two canvas elements, one to draw the
								button, always centered in the page with some CSS magic, and the other covering the whole page where the sentences are
								contantly redrawn. Two Javascript classes take care of the senteces in a master-slaves fashion, the master is given
								the instruction of how many senteces we need and he instanciates them keeping a reference in an array. Through requestAnimationFrame
								a drawAll method of the master class is called periodically which clears the canvas and calls all the draw methods of
								the slave classes which each one redraws itself advancing then in position. When a sentence gets under the screen it
								is time to create a new one, requesting a sentence to the server and then recalculate all the dimensions. 
							</p>
							<p>Server-side there is not much going on, mostly logging statistics and moving data in or out the database. Maybe the most
								interesting part about the server is that it runs on a headless RaspberryPi connected to my home ADSL. The server <i>serves</i>
								this very site too, not without struggle, but it works for the low traffic we are talking about. The Afraid Dynamic
								DNS is used, great project by the way.
							</p>
			
							<p>The code can be found on GitHub and for question you can use the form in the bio page.</p>
