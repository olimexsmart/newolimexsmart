    Generally, in a flat complex there is one common entrance at ground level with a locked door.
    Every resident has a copy of the key for the door. In order to being able to open the main
    entrance remotely in case of incoming guests, each apartment has a doorphone.
    This is the nominal scenario, but my home lacks the doorphone part. When I have some guests,
    the only solution to let them in is to physically run down 7 floors and open the main entrance door.

    Since this is not acceptable, I needed to develop a solution. It is important to know that I had acces
    to another doorphone of the flat complex, being a friend of mine. The first idea was to build
    a remote control in VHF or repurpose a garage opener, implementing a direct, on-off, communication.
    This has proven to be more complex than expected from the points of view of range of the
    communication, it needed to travel across sevaral concrete walls, and of security of the system.
    Garage door openers are notoriously easy to crack, while VHF modules require the implementation
    of some sort of access protocol, otherwise the system would react to any kind of noise.

    The design shifted towards a IoT solution, allowing to solve the communication problem by using
    the Internet. At this point the possibilities where immense in respect to pure point to point custom
    system. I decided to take the project to the next level, implementing a server that publishes
    a web page that anyone can load. Access would be granted by inserting a key into a form.
    As a consequent requirement, an administrator needs to be able of managing the keys.
    <br>
    All of this was achieved with an Arduino system on a ATMega328p, connected to an Ethernet module,
    a relé, a microSD card reader and a DS1307 real time clock. Incredibly enough, I could not find a simple library that implements
    an HTTP protocol parser, able to provide the basic information needed namely the method (POST or GET at least), the
    resource path and the aventual message. Access to the headers can be useful, but those are definitely too cumbersome
    for 2KB of RAM. In conclusion, I needed to write my own HTTP parser implementation, with the priority
    of being fast and frugal in terms of memory consumption.

    There are two web pages, the index page contains the log in form, along with some informations like
    the total number of openings and the some links. The other page is the administrator panel,
    where is possible to add, remove, check the active access keys. The administrator has a master key that
    allows these modifications.
    All the files necessary for the web pages are saved in the microSD card. Along with those, two files contain the master and normal access keys.
    Several log files are constantly updated by the system.
    The clock is necessary to manage the automatic expiration of keys, which can have a maximum validity of one year.
    The relé is wired to the button of the doorphone at my friend apartment.

    With this setup I can now provide to my guests the address of the site and a key which expires, for example,
    in 6 hours. They are able to open the complex doors by themselves. In addition, this has proven to be quite handy
    for myself and my friend, since now we don't have to search for the key every time we want to get home.
